# Data Story Telling

Introduction
For the final project, you will create an explanatory data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, and your final deliverable will be a write up along with a Tableau Public workbook.

We will provide some options of data sets to explore; however, you may choose to explore an entirely different data set. You should be aware that finding your own data set and cleaning it using Python, R, or some other language can take considerable time and effort. This can add as much as a day, a week, or even months to your project so embark on the adventure to find and clean a data set if you are truly prepared with data wrangling skills.

The Data

A data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.
